# Atomic Settlement - Two phase commit protocol

## Introduction 

Atomic settlement across two different platforms is well described below by [Paul Krzyzanowski](https://people.cs.rutgers.edu/~pxk/417/notes/transactions.html)

> A key facet of a transaction is that it keeps data consistent even in
> case of system failures. Transactions are atomic â€” all results must be
> made permanent (commit) and appear to anyone outside the transaction
> as an indivisible action. If a transaction cannot complete, it must
> abort, reverting the state of the system to that before it ran

The underlying mechanism used is a [Two Phase Commit protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-phase_commit_protocol).

## Building blocks for two phase commit 

### ERC 20 
The foundations for two phase commit building blocks in Ethereum Contracts was in the [ERC 20](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc20#IERC20) contract definition.  ERC 20 had two functions that were used in conjunction with each other
 - `approve`
 - `transferFrom`

This is used in the case where a sender wants to `approve` an amount to be transferred and gives the spender the authority to complete the transfer using the `transferFrom` function

### ERC 2020
This concept was further refined in the [ERC 2020](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2020) contract definition which is otherwise called the E-Money Standard Token.  This token allows the wallet owner to place a hold on funds for a specific beneficiary.

> **Holds**: token balances can be put on hold, which will make the held amount unavailable for further use until the hold is resolved (i.e. either executed or released). Holds have a payer, a payee, and a notary who is in charge of resolving the hold. Holds also implement expiration periods, after which anyone can release the hold Holds are similar to escrows in that are firm and lead to final settlement. Holds can also be used to implement collateralization.

In simple terms if Party A wants to transfer an asset, on one network to Party B, in exchange for a different asset on a different network, then the process would be:
1. Party A places a hold on asset 1 on network 1 with Party B as the beneficiary and Notary A as the notary
2. Party B places a hold on asset 2 on network 2 with Party A as the beneficiary and Notary A as the notary
3. Notary A checks both holds are in place and are correct and then executes both holds
4. If Notary A decides that anything is wrong in the process, then Notary A releases both holds which cancels the holds, allowing the assets to be used for other transactions

### Proof based Atomic transactions 

Using the process above, there is an obvious dependency on the Notary to effect the atomic settlement which introduces risk into the system.

One of the ways of mitigating this risk is to change the process slightly.  The change is that each chain has some logic on it that simply verifies a proof that an event occurred on the other chain.  That logic (could be embedded in a smart contract) is the designated notary on the transaction and can therefore ensure settlement happens on one chain if and only if settlement can be guaranteed on the other chain.

These proofs are covered in more detail [here]("./cross_chain_proofs.md").

Once settlement has occurred on one chain, a proof of settlement can be sent back to the other chain which completed the settlement process on the other chain.    

The beauty of this construct is that there is no requirement to have a trusted intermediary that could block settlement occurring on one or both chains.  Any entity can generate and transfer proofs between the two chains.
